# Problem: 
We want to create a tool that can automatically gather a professor's publication record from different sources like Google Scholar and DBLP.And Further store it into an Excel Sheet.

# How it works:
Input: You provide the professor's name and the years you're interested in.
Data Collection: The tool searches online databases for publications by that professor during those years.
Output: The tool creates a summary of the professor's publications, which you can use for their profile.

# Benefits:
Saves time: No need to manually search and collect publications.
Accuracy: Ensures the information is up-to-date and accurate.
Customizable: You can choose the specific years and publication types you're interested in.
